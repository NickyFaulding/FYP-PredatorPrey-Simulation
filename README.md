# FYP Predator-Prey Simulation 🦊🐰

## Final year project for Software Engineering Degree  @ Sheffield Hallam University

Implements Craig W. Reynolds Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters to simulate an environment containing predators and prey.

The simulation can be seen in action [here](https://nickyfaulding.github.io/FYP-PredatorPrey-Simulation/) hosted on my GitHub.io (thanks GitHub 😊)

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@nickyfaulding](https://twitter.com/nickyfaulding) if you would like to chat about this project 😊.

## For further reading / interest 📖
Steering Behaviours, I heavily referenced Craig W. Reynolds paper which can be found here: [Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/).

I also implemented my own interpretation of the Lotka Volterra algorithm: [Lotka Volterra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations)

Web Assembly was implemented using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)

Graphics were implemented using [RayLib](https://www.raylib.com/) (Ray is a very nice person! Join their Discord!)
